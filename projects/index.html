        <h3>Website Recreations</h3>

        <p>In my class at Stevens College, we were tasked with trying to recreate certain websites to be as accurate as possible in terms of layout. You can find this project on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/snauman817/more-css-practice">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>More Recreations</h3>

        <p>Another class project. We were to recreate a website that required a little more depth, and I chose Walmart's website. My recreation isn't 100% done yet, but you can find it on my Codepen <a href="https://codepen.io/snauman817/pen/wYGLVP">here</a>.</p>
