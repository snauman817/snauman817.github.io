      <h1>Hi, I'm Spencer Nauman</h1>
      <p>I am a student developer at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology with both front-end and back-end experience. I'm 18 years old, fresh out of Warwick High School where I took a couple coding classes. It's those classes that I thank for my current love of programming! </p>

          <h2>Past Work</h2>

          <p>I interned during High School and worked over the summer previously at Clair Global in Lititz as part of the development team. Through this opportunity, I was able to gain knowledge on Powershell and the Windows OS, as well as meet some really cool people.</p>
