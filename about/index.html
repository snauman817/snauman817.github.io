        <h2>Past Work</h2>
        <p>I began my internship at Clair Global about halfway through my senior year of high school. It was our school's first time doing a programming related internship, and I and three others were welcomed onto their team at the start of the second semester. Our primary task was to help create scripts in Powershell. It was really hard to get into learning this new language at first, but as time went on we managed to become quite alright at it. The end of the school year came around eventually, and I and one of the other students were welcomed to stay over the summer and keep working there. We went a lot more advanced into Powershell things and even dabbled in other things like SQL.</p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge computer nerd and Super Smash Brothers player. My brother and I have built a gaming computer together, although it's been seeing less use since the school year began. I just find it really cool that something so advanced and powerful is actually quite simple to build.</p>
        <p>I also really enjoy playing and watching Super Smash Brothers, specifically the newest installment. I sometimes attend tournaments in the area, and I play primarily Bayonetta and Fox although I dabble in Pacman because I find him really fun.</p>

        <h2>Current Schooling</h2>
        <p>I am attending my first year at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, and I'm in their Computer Software Engineering class. I learned a bunch of really valuable HTML semantics so far, which I was never taught before in High School, and I can't wait to learn even more.</p>
