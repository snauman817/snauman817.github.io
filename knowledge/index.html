          <p>I have taken a full year of Internet programming in high school, and have been learning it in college as well. This is among my most confident skillsets when it comes to languages to code in.</p>

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <article>
          <p>I took both an introductory course to Java and a Computer Science course which focused on Java a decent bit more in-depth. The intro course was a year long, and we built a number of interactive games and programs using Java's JFrames and the likewise tools.</p>
          <p>Computer Science was an AP course which looked more into theory than practice, although I learned many valuable things like data structures, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms. On the AP test for Computer Science, I scored a 5.</p>

        <h2>Powershell</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Powershell is the language in which I have the most time put into practical application. I used Powershell almost exclusively during my time at Clair Global, and have a pretty decent understanding of what it is capable of and how to use it. It is also proof that I am able to learn other languages through the knowledge I have accrued during High School.</p>
